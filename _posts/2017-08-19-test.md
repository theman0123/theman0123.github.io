This article assumes you know some programming. Python is an easy language to pick up, but if you’ve never written in python, I suggest you get it installed and learn how to set up a virtual environment prior to reading this. 

Download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

check out this virtual environment article [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)
