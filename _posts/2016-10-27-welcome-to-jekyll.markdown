I just wanted to make sure I know how to post on my own webpage. I mean coding isn't easy and there's not always someone there to tell you what to do. A lot of the learning just comes from actually doing stuff and that is easier said than done when you first learn to code. And I don't know Ruby... which i think jekyll is using... but how much does that matter? I'll learn some Ruby, just not today.
